# Continuous Integration

There are a few continuous integration processes that should be implemented with every code base.  They usually include:

* `pytests`: Independent unit tests to verify that code is functional.
* `coverage`: Checking which parts of the code are executed during unit testing.
* `profile`: Identify bottlenecks in the code to and measure performance.
* `autodoc`: Automatic generation of documenation based on code and comments.
